# My Photography Portfolio

Welcome to my photography portfolio! This project showcases my collection of photographs, focusing on surroundings and food. It serves as a personal gallery where I preserve moments through the lens, capturing the beauty in everyday life.

## Live Page

## Project Overview

This website is designed to be a minimalist and visually appealing photography portfolio. The gallery is split into different categories, and each photo is displayed in a grid format with a hover zoom effect. The site also includes sections about me and a contact form with social media buttons for Facebook, Twitter, and email.

## Features
